YOLO Bot - An algorithmic trading bot

## Project Proposal

Python based
Use Glassnode API
 - indicators tbd
Select charts
Plug glassnode chart api data into machine learning to create a Buy, Hodl, or Sell signal (1, 0, -1). 
Backtest the algorithm through the previous 4 years, reduce if data load is too great
Analyze the profitability of the trading algorithm through visualizations

Optional: Add an api that allows taking action through a paper trading platform (alpaca)
